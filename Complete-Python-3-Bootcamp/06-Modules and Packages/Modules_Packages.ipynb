    "A **package**, on the other hand, is a collection of modules organized in a directory. Packages allow us to group multiple related modules together under a common namespace, making it easier to organize and structure our code base."

    "# Working with Modules\n",
    "Modules can be imported and used in other programs, modules, and packages. They’re very beneficial in an application, since they break down the application function into smaller, manageable, and logical units.\n",
    "\n",
    "For instance, say we want to create a web application: the application is going to need code for connecting to a database, code for creating database models, code that’s going to be executed when a user visits a certain route, and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can put all the code in one file, but then the code very quickly becomes unmaintainable and unreadable. By using modules, we can break down the code into units that are more manageable. We’ll put all the code needed to connect to the database in one file, code for database models is put in another file, and code for the routes into a module. Breaking the code down into those modules promotes organization, reusability, and maintainability."
